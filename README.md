# REACT-MARIO-GAME 


React clicky game is built with React.js. Application renders different images. Each image listens to click events. It keeps a track of user's score. Score is incremented when an image is clicked for the first time. User's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. The images rendered to the page are shuffled in a random order after every click. Game restarts after user's score reset.
